malloc, free, calloc, realloc 

allocate and free dynamic memory

#include <stdlib.h>

void free(void *ptr);

void *malloc(size_t size);
void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

free()
function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, 
which must have been returned by a previous call to 
malloc(), calloc() or realloc(). 
Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before, 
undefined behavior occurs. 
If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

malloc() 
function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. 
The memory is not initialized.

calloc() 
function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each 
and returns a pointer to the allocated memory. 
The memory is set to zero.

realloc() 
function changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr to size bytes. 
The contents will be unchanged in the range from the start of the region 
up to the minimum of the old and new sizes. 
If the new size is larger than the old size, the added memory 
will not be initialized. 
If ptr is NULL, then the call is equivalent to malloc(size), 
for all values of size; 
if size is equal to zero, and ptr is not NULL, 
then the call is equivalent to free(ptr). Unless ptr is NULL, 
it must have been returned by an earlier call to 
malloc(), calloc() or realloc(). 
If the area pointed to was moved, a free(ptr) is done.

Return Value:
free() function returns no value.
malloc() and calloc() functions 
return a pointer to the allocated memory that is suitably aligned 
for any kind of variable. On error, these functions return NULL
realloc() function returns a pointer to the newly allocated memory, 
or NULL if the request fails

-------------------------------------------

isatty 

test whether a file descriptor refers to a terminal.

#include <unistd.h>

int isatty(int fd);

isatty() 
function tests whether fd is an open file descriptor referring to a terminal.

Return Value:
returns 1 if fd is an open file descriptor referring to a terminal; 
otherwise 0 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

-------------------------------------------

getline

delimited string input

#include <stdio.h>

ssize_t getline(char **linptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream);

getline() 
reads an entire line from stream, 
storing the address of the buffer containing the text into *lineptr. 
The buffer is null-terminated and includes the newline character, 
if one was found.
If *lineptr is NULL, 
then getline() will allocate a buffer for storing the line, 
which should be freed by the user program. 
(In this case, the value in *n is ignored.)
Alternatively, before calling getline(), 
*lineptr can contain a pointer to a malloc(3)-allocated buffer *n bytes in size. 
If the buffer is not large enough to hold the line, 
getline() resizes it with realloc(3), 
updating *lineptr and *n as necessary.
In either case, on a successful call, *lineptr and *n will be updated 
to reflect the buffer address and allocated size respectively.

Return Value:
On success, return the number of characters read, 
including the delimiter character, 
but not including the terminating null byte. 
on failure to read a line -1 returned  

-------------------------------------------

strtok

extract tokens from strings

#include <string.h>

char *strtok(char *str, const char *delim);

strtok() 
function parses a string into a sequence of tokens. 
On the first call to strtok() the string to be parsed should be specified in str. 
In each subsequent call that should parse the same string, 
str should be NULL.

The delim argument specifies a set of bytes that delimit the tokens 
in the parsed string. The caller may specify different strings 
in delim in successive calls that parse the same string.

Each call to strtok() returns a pointer to a null-terminated string 
containing the next token. 
This string does not include the delimiting byte. 
If no more tokens are found, strtok() returns NULL.

Return Value
The strtok() return a pointer to the next token, 
or NULL if there are no more tokens.

-------------------------------------------

fork

creat a child process 

#include <unistd.h>

pid_t fork(void);

fork() 
creates a new process by duplicating the calling process. 
The new process, referred to as the child, 
is an exact duplicate of the calling process, 
referred to as the parent

The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open file descriptors.
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open message queue descriptors
The child inherits copies of the parent's set of open directory streams

Return value:
On success, the PID of the child process is returned in the parent, 
and 0 is returned in the child. 
On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, no child process is created, 
and errno is set appropriately.

-------------------------------------------

wait

wait, waitpid, - wait for process to change state

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

pid_t wait(int *status);

pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *status, int options);

All of these system calls are used to wait for state changes in a child 
of the calling process, 
and obtain information about the child whose state has changed.

wait() system call suspends execution of the calling process 
until one of its children terminates. 
The call wait(&status) is equivalent to: waitpid(-1, &status, 0);

waitpid() system call suspends execution of the calling process 
until a child specified by pid argument has changed state. 
By default, waitpid() waits only for terminated children, 
but this behavior is modifiable via the options argument

The value of pid can be:

pid < -1 meaning wait for any child process 
whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of pid.

pid = -1 meaning wait for any child process.

pid = 0 meaning wait for any child process 
whose process group ID is equal to that of the calling process.

pid > 0 meaning wait for the child 
whose process ID is equal to the value of pid.

Return Value wait()
on success, returns the process ID of the terminated child; 
on error, -1 is returned.

Return Value waitpid()
on success, returns the process ID of the child whose state has changed;
On error, -1 is returned.

-------------------------------------------
WEXITSTATUS(status)
returns the exit status of the child.
-------------------------------------------


wait3 wait4

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

argv is an array of argument strings passed to the new program
envp is an array of strings, conventionally of the form key=value, 
which are passed as environment to the new program
Both argv and envp must be terminated by a NULL pointer.

Return value:
on success dosen't Return
on error -1 returned

-------------------------------------------

execve(argv[1], argv, environ);
perror("execve"); /* execve() only returns on error */
exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

perror

print a system error message

#include <stdio.h>

void perror(const char *s);

#include <errno.h>

const char *sys_errlist[];
int sys_nerr;
int errno;

perror() 
produces a message on the standard error output, 
describing the last error encountered during a call to a system or library function. 
First (if s is not NULL and *s is not a null byte ('\0')) 
the argument string s is printed, followed by a colon and a blank. 
Then the message and a new-line.

the argument string 
should include the name of the function that incurred the error. 
The error number is taken from the external variable errno, 
which is set when errors occur but not cleared when successful calls are made.

The global error list sys_errlist[] 
indexed by errno can be used to obtain the error message without the newline.

-------------------------------------------




access

terminate a normal process

#include <stdlib.h>

void exit(int status);

exit()
function causes normal process termination 
and the value of status & 0377 is returned to the parent

#include <unistd.h>

void _exit(int status);

_exit() 
terminates the calling process "immediately". 
Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed; 
any children of the process are inherited by process 1, init, 
and the process's parent is sent a SIGCHLD signal.
The value status is returned to the parent process 
as the process's exit status

Return value:
dosen't Return any value

-------------------------------------------

fflush

flush a stream

#include <stdio.h>

int fflush(FILE *stream);

For output streams, fflush() 
forces a write of all user-space buffered data for the given output 
or update stream via the stream's underlying write function. 

For input streams, fflush() 
discards any buffered data that has been fetched from the underlying file, 
but has not been consumed by the application

These functions are always successful.

-------------------------------------------



kill

send signal to a process

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <signal.h>

int kill(pid_t pid, int sig);

kill() 
system call can be used to send any signal to any process group or process.
If pid is positive, 
then signal sig is sent to the process with the ID specified by pid.
If pid equals 0,
then sig is sent to every process in the process group of the calling process.
If pid equals -1, 
then sig is sent to every process for which the calling process 
has permission to send signals, except for process 1 (init)
If pid is less than -1, 
then sig is sent to every process in the process group whose ID is -pid.
If sig is 0, 
then no signal is sent, but error checking is still performed; 
this can be used to check for the existence of a process ID or process group ID.

Return Value:
On success (at least one signal was sent), zero is returned. 
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

-------------------------------------------

malloc

void *malloc(size_t size);

-------------------------------------------

open

open and possibly create a file or device

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);

Given a pathname for a file, 
open() 
returns a file descriptor, 
a small, nonnegative integer for use in subsequent system calls 
(read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2), etc.).

The argument flags 
must include one of the following access modes:
O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR. O_APPEND, O_CREAT, O_TRUNC

0007 others have read, write and execute permission

Return Value
on success the new file descriptor, returned
on error -1 returned

-------------------------------------------

on success a pointer to the directory stream. returned
On error, NULL is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

-------------------------------------------

readdir 

read a directory

#include <dirent.h>

struct dirent *readdir(DIR *dirp);

readdir() 
function returns a pointer to a dirent structure 
representing the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed to by dirp. 
It returns NULL on reaching the end of the directory stream 
or if an error occurred.

Return Value
On success, a pointer to a dirent structure. returned
If the end of the directory stream is reached, NULL is returned

on error NULL is returned and errno is set appropriately.


-------------------------------------------



read

read from a file descriptor

#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);

read() 
attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd 
into the buffer starting at buf.

If count is greater than SSIZE_MAX, the result is unspecified.

Return Value:
On success, the number of bytes read is returned 
(zero indicates end of file)
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

-------------------------------------------

write 

write to a file descriptor

#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);

write() 
writes up to count bytes from the buffer pointed buf 
to the file referred to by the file descriptor fd.

Return Value
On success, the number of bytes written is returned 
(zero indicates nothing was written). 
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

-------------------------------------------

signal 

ANSI C signal handling

#include <signal.h>

typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);
sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);

signal() 
sets the disposition of the signal signum to handler, 
which is either SIG_IGN, SIG_DFL, 
or the address of a programmer-defined function (a "signal handler").

If the signal signum is delivered to the process, 
then one of the following happens:
If the disposition is set to SIG_IGN, then the signal is ignored.
If the disposition is set to SIG_DFL, then the default action 
associated with the signal occurs.
The signals SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be caught or ignored.

Return Value
on success the previous value of the signal handler, returned 
on error SIG_ERR returned

-------------------------------------------


















stat

stat, fstat, lstat - get file status

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int stat(const char *path, struct stat *buf);
int fstat(int fd, struct stat *buf);
int lstat(const char *path, struct stat *buf);

These functions return information about a file. 
No permissions are required on the file itself, 
but-in the case of stat() and lstat() - 
execute (search) permission is required on all of the directories in path that lead to the file.

stat() stats the file pointed to by path and fills in buf.
lstat() is identical to stat(), except that if path is a symbolic link, 
then the link itself is stat-ed, not the file that it refers to.
fstat() is identical to stat(), except that the file to be stat-ed 
is specified by the file descriptor fd.

All of these system calls return a stat structure, 
which contains the following fields:

struct stat {
	dev_t     st_dev;     /* ID of device containing file */
	ino_t     st_ino;     /* inode number */
	mode_t    st_mode;    /* protection */
	nlink_t   st_nlink;   /* number of hard links */
	uid_t     st_uid;     /* user ID of owner */
	gid_t     st_gid;     /* group ID of owner */
	dev_t     st_rdev;    /* device ID (if special file) */
	off_t     st_size;    /* total size, in bytes */
	blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for file system I/O */
	blkcnt_t  st_blocks;  /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
	time_t    st_atime;   /* time of last access */
	time_t    st_mtime;   /* time of last modification */
	time_t    st_ctime;   /* time of last status change */
};

Return Value
On success, zero is returned. 
On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.
